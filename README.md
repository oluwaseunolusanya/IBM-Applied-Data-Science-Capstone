# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone

Welcome to the **IBM Applied Data Science Capstone** repository. This project serves as the final assessment for the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) on Coursera. It encapsulates the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program, focusing on real-world data science applications.

## 📘 Project Overview

In this capstone project, we assume the role of data scientists at a startup aiming to compete with SpaceX. The objective is to predict the success of Falcon 9 rocket landings using historical launch data. This involves:

* **Data Collection**: Gathering datasets from various sources.
* **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data patterns and relationships.
* **Data Visualization**: Creating informative visual representations.
* **Model Development**: Building machine learning models to predict landing success.
* **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance and accuracy.
